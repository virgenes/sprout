/* Host input -> guest, through the one channel the engine actually has.
 *
 * PvZ2 takes ALL input (touch, keys, text) through a single Java call:
 * AndroidGameApp.UI_ProcessEvents(ByteBuffer). There are no Native_onKey*
 * entry points -- the binary even carries "Unimplemented Android
 * implementation of IAppDriver::KeyDown called - this is an error" -- and the
 * keyboard JNI surface is only ShowKeyboard/HideKeyboard/IsKeyboardShowing,
 * none of which returns text.
 *
 * So the host side queues events here and the UI_ProcessEvents hook serialises
 * them into the engine's buffer once per frame. Going through the JNI method
 * rather than patching the native input path is deliberate: hooks are keyed by
 * (class, method) name, which is stable across game versions, whereas .so
 * offsets are not.
 *
 * The pushers are C-callable because main.c's SDL loop is C. */

/* Phases, matching the sub-type sub_9F0298 switches on at record +36.
 *
 * UP is 3 and MOVE is 1 -- NOT the other way round, however much the numbering
 * suggests it. Read out of the handlers themselves:
 *   0 -> sub_9E8208  driver vtable +432  appends the touch, sets app[221]=1
 *   1 -> sub_9E8378  driver vtable +440  overwrites the entry IN PLACE  => MOVE
 *   3 -> sub_9E8528  driver vtable +436  clears app[221] AND erases the
 *                                        entry from the touch vector => UP/END
 *   4 -> sub_9E8828  driver vtable +444  clears the whole vector      => CANCEL
 * The vtable order (down/up/move/cancel) is the giveaway; the dispatch-table
 * index order simply does not match it.
 *
 * Getting these two backwards is what made a click leave its button stuck in
 * the pressed state forever: the engine never saw a TouchUp, so the button
 * never fired, app[221] stayed 1 (dropping every later DOWN under single
 * touch), and the never-erased touches grew the vector without bound. */
