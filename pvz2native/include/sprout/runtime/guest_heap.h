/* General-purpose malloc/free heap for guest code (and our own JNI array
 * allocations), backed by a carved-out region of the emulated address
 * space. Bookkeeping (free list / allocated sizes) lives on the host side;
 * guest code only ever sees the payload pointers it asked for.
 *
 * The free list is indexed twice -- by address, to coalesce neighbours, and
 * by size, to find a block -- so both malloc and free are O(log m) in the
 * number of free blocks. It used to be one vector that alloc scanned
 * linearly and free re-sorted in full, which is O(m log m) per free: fine
 * for the first thousand allocations and ruinous by the millionth. Loading
 * the resource groups fragments the heap into thousands of holes, and
 * onSurfaceCreated's ~6.9M allocations were costing ~16us each -- 113
 * seconds in one call, degrading as it went, which is what made the boot
 * look like it had hung rather than slowed. */
